# PP2-Experiment
This is the testing experiment conducted by Jing Li in 09, 2023 at Canberra

## Background:

The Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra identified a need to enhance public transportation support for its students and staff. Given the diverse needs of the university community and the city's infrastructure, it was essential to gather feedback and ideas to ensure the proposed solutions were effective and well-received. An experiment was designed to understand the impact of different levels of community participation on the satisfaction with the proposed transportation solutions.

## Methodology:

### Participants:

40 residents of Canberra were chosen for the study.
They were divided into two groups of 20 each.
- Group A (High Participation Group):

Engaged in a 10-day consultation and feedback process.
Every member was encouraged to share their ideas and feedback regarding public transportation support.
- Group B (Moderate Participation Group):

Feedback was collected from 5 random members.
The core team then refined these ideas to develop a transportation solution.
## Process:

Initial Briefing: Both groups were informed about the objective of enhancing public transportation support but were unaware of the different methodologies applied to each group.

- Consultation Phase (Group A):

Day 1-3: Open forums were organized where participants discussed their transportation needs and challenges.
Day 4-6: Preliminary transportation solutions based on feedback were presented, followed by another feedback session.
Day 7-10: Final transportation plans were showcased, with opportunities for last-minute feedback.
- Idea Collection Phase (Group B):

Day 1: Feedback was collected from 5 random members through individual interviews.
Day 2-5: The core team developed a transportation solution based on the feedback and their expertise.
- Presentation: Both groups were presented with the final transportation solutions.

### Feedback Collection: Feedback was collected post-presentation using a standardized questionnaire.

### Questionnaire:

On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with the proposed transportation solution?
Do you believe your feedback was considered in the final solution? (Yes/No)
What elements of the solution do you appreciate the most?
What elements of the solution do you think need revision?
Would you utilize the proposed transportation solution? (Yes/No)
## Results (Fake Data):

- Group A (High Participation Group):

Average Satisfaction Score: 7.1/10
70% believed their feedback was considered.
Most appreciated feature: Increased bus frequency.
Most suggested revision: Extended service hours.
75% would utilize the proposed solution.
- Group B (Moderate Participation Group):

Average Satisfaction Score: 8.7/10
90% believed their feedback was considered.
Most appreciated feature: New bus routes covering more areas.
Most suggested revision: More eco-friendly buses.
92% would utilize the proposed solution.
## Conclusion:

The results suggest that Group B, with moderate participation, expressed higher satisfaction with the transportation solution compared to Group A, which had high participation. This indicates that a combination of targeted feedback and expert decision-making might lead to more effective solutions.
